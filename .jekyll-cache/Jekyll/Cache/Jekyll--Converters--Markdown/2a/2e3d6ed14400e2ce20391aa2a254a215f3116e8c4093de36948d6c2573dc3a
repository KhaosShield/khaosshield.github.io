<p>Thanks for checking out my blog. I‚Äôm Rick or as most people will see around here <em>‚ÄòKhaosShield‚Äô</em> (Because you can‚Äôt be an elite hacker without some trendy handle). 
I‚Äôm new to this journey into Infosec, After re-watching a film that i hadnt seen in years and quite frankly forgot all about (Hackers - yea i forgot about it!) 
it re-sparked an interest into something I originally picked up during highschool.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to ‚ÄòHacking‚Äô during my early highschool years. A friend had shown me a way of bypassing the security &amp; gaining Admin rights by simply creating a folder 
and adding strings to the name to give you certain privledges (a quick google search says this is still the case). Now at the time all we simply wanted to do was waste our lunch breaks playing Age of Empires 2.</p>

<p>Jump to present day. Currently serving in the UK Armed Forces for 10+ years in a combat role that isnt TOO far removed from Cyber‚Ä¶.meaning we do use computers i guess. However i find that the more i work towards rooting machines &amp; completeing challenges on HackTheBox, VulnHub, TryHackMe and other platforms the job satisfaction is starting
to take a dowards slope. And so here i am, currently studying in my spare time, learning as much as i can about Networking, PenTesting, Cyber Security, Python and much more to hopefully take that leap into the world of Cybers and catch a job ive always wanted.</p>
