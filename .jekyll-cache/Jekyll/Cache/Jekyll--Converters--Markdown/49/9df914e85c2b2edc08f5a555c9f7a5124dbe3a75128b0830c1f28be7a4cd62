<p>Thanks for checking out my blog. I’m Rick or as most people will see around here <em>‘KhaosShield’</em> (Because you can’t be an elite hacker without some trendy handle). 
I’m new to this journey into Infosec, After re-watching a film that i hadnt seen in years and quite frankly forgot all about (Hackers - yea i forgot about it!) 
it re-sparked an interest into something I originally picked up during highschool.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to ‘Hacking’ during my early highschool years. A friend had shown me a way of bypassing the security &amp; gaining Admin rights by simply creating a folder 
and adding strings to the name to give you certain privledges (a quick google search says this is still the case). Now at the time all we simply wanted to do was waste our lunch breaks playing Age of Empires 2. <strong>Fast Foward a few years</strong></p>
