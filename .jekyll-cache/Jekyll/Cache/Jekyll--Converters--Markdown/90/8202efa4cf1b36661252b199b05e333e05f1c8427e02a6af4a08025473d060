<hr />

<p>$~&gt; So after discussing some possible certifications in the previous blog post (OSCP - Thoughts &amp; Certs) i was browsing the internet like you do and when i checked my emails i found none other than an invitation to try eLearnSecurityâ€™s ePTS v4 Barebones Edition. So having said i would check them out in the last post i figured â€˜hey why not?â€™. So after a quick password reset on the account i must of used to enquire about certs a while ago i hopped right in and decided to see what all the fuss is aboutâ€¦.</p>
