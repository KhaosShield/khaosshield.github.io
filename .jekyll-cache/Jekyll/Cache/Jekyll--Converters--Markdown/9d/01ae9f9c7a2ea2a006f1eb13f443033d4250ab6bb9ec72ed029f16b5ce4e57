  <p>This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch; the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder,  cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe itâ€™s for our own good, yet weâ€™re the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.â€ Huh? Right? Manifesto? â€œYou may stop me, but you canâ€™t stop us all.â€</p>
