<hr />

<p>$~&gt; So after discussing some possible certifications in the previous blog post (OSCP - Thoughts &amp; Certs) i was browsing the internet like you do and when i checked my emails i found none other than an invitation to try eLearnSecurity‚Äôs ePTS v4 Barebones Edition. So having said i would check them out in the last post i figured ‚Äòhey why not?‚Äô. So after a quick password reset on the account i must of used to enquire about certs a while ago i hopped right in and decided to see what all the fuss is about‚Ä¶.</p>

<h3 id="first-impressions"><a href="#header-3"></a>First Impressions</h3>

<p>So eLearnSecurity, they say first impressions are everything and from instantly logging into the Caendra portal you can tell they mean business. The members area is well thought out and easy for anyone to navigate. You will be greeted by the list of courses they have to offer and at the top of this list will be the course your subscribed to.</p>

<p>So theres a few different ‚Äòeditions‚Äô to the ePTS course, ‚ÄòBarebones‚Äô ‚ÄòFull‚Äô &amp; ‚ÄòElite‚Äô. The Full plan comes with 30 hours of lab time &amp; a free retake at the test &amp;&amp; the Elite plan has 60 hours of lab time +3 retakes, Your also able to download the course content and slides in PDF format. Now the course as a whole is aimed at ‚Äúabsolute beginners in IT Security‚Äù so offering more lab time and the option to study offline for those less confident can only be a good thing.</p>

<p>However im enrolled in the Barebones Edition of the course, This is quite literally what it says on the tin, you have access to the slides for each subject but none of the training materials or labs that can help you through each particular stage, but before we get into that lets look at the syllabus and what we are going to be covering.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-syllabus"><a href="#header-3"></a>The Syllabus</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Information Gathering</li>
  <li>Footprinting and Scanning</li>
  <li>Vulnerability Assessment</li>
  <li>Web Attacks</li>
  <li>System Attacks</li>
  <li>Network Attacks</li>
  <li>Next Steps</li>
</ol>

<p>Now‚Ä¶ having access to only the slides (no videos, no PDF, no Hera Labs) i can honestly say that following through the information contained within is still fantastic. The modules are well thought out and easy to follow, the information is clear and well structured. With a little Google-Fu when presented with a ‚ÄòNow go watch the eLearn Buffer Overflow Video‚Äô all i simply did was fill the gap with a YouTube video that followed roughly the same path.</p>

<p>The authors of the course walk you through each step and at no point was i lost or confused, At the end of each module you can access the Hera Labs (assuming your on the Full or Elite editions) which can guide you through everything you have just learnt.</p>

<p>Now my slides did have a tendency to time out and just give me a loading image which is more than likely something on my end and a simple close and re-open did fix the issue and this is about the only bad thing i can say about the entire course‚Ä¶. which isnt even bad!</p>

<h3 id="conclusion"><a href="#header-3"></a>Conclusion‚Ä¶</h3>

<p>After taking the Brebones edition of ePTS &amp; not being able to take the eJPT exam (Junior Penetration Tester) or have access to the labs‚Ä¶which after reading reviews are absolutely fantastic the first thing i will be doing when i finish writing this is signing up to the ‚ÄòFull‚Äô edition of ePTS and going through all the slides &amp; the extra content, i cant wait to jump into the Hera Labs and take the eJPT Exam. As far as the Barebone edition goes it does its job, it piques your interest and gives a fantastic insight into the content that eLearnSecurity has to offer. Stay tuned for what is hopefully another Cert to add to the small collection‚Ä¶..Keep Hacking! @Khaos</p>
