<p>Thanks for checking out my blog. Iâ€™m Rick or as most people will see around here <em>â€˜KhaosShieldâ€™</em> (Because you canâ€™t be an elite hacker without some trendy handle). 
Iâ€™m new to this journey into Infosec, After re-watching a film that i hadnt seen in years and quite frankly forgot all about (Hackers - yea i forgot about it!) 
it re-sparked an interest into something I originally picked up during highschool.</p>
