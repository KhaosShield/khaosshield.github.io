### [](#header-3)>HackTheBox & VulnHub OSCP 
If you read TJNull's OSCP study guide above (Which you should have) then you will see he has created a fantastic resource of OSCP like machines available on both HackTheBox & VulnHub. As im currently subscribed to HTB VIP in order to access the "Retired" machines ive extracted the following image to here for a quick reference. Ill flesh this out as we go on and post writeups in the relevant section as i make my way through each box.
